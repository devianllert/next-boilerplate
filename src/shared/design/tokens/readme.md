Design Tokens are used in place of hard-coded values and variables in order to ensure flexibility and unity across all product experiences and/or platforms. They are also platform-agnostic so it makes it easier to communicate with developers using these terms.

Design Tokens are not only useful for colors. They should also be useful for everything that gives your Design System personality and character â€” something I like to call The Anatomy of a Design System.

- Color
- Typography
- Space (dimensions, padding, margins, etc)
