/**
 * Configure Sentry default scope.
 *
 * Used by both sentry config files (client/server).
 * Also configures the default scope, subsequent calls to "configureScope" will enrich the scope.
 * Must only contain tags/contexts/extras that are universal (not server or browser specific).
 *
 * The Sentry scope will be enriched by:
 * - BrowserPageBootstrap, for browser-specific metadata.
 * - ServerPageBootstrap, for server-specific metadata.
 * - API endpoints, for per-API additional metadata.
 * - React components, for per-component additional metadata.
 *
 * Doesn't initialize Sentry if SENTRY_DSN isn't defined.
 * Re-exports the Sentry object to make it simpler to consume by developers (DX).
 *
 * Automatically applied on the browser, thanks to @sentry/nextjs.
 * Automatically applied on the server, thanks to @sentry/nextjs, when "withSentry" HOC is used.
