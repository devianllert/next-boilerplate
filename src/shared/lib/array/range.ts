/**
 * Generate an array of numbers, for iteration
 *
 * @example
 * // You can pass a single number, to generate a range from 0 through that number:
 * range(5); // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
 *
 * // You can pass two numbers, to generate a range from start to finish:
 * range(5, 10); // [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
 *
 * // Finally, you can pass a third "step" argument, if you want to change the gap between numbers:
 * range(0, 6, 2); // [0, 2, 4]
 * range(10, 12, 0.5); // [10, 10.5, 11, 11.5]
 *
 * @note
 * You'll notice that the array produced is inclusive of the starting number, but exclusive of the ending number.
 * `range(10, 20)` includes 10, but does not include 20.
 * This is done intentionally, to match the behaviour of JavaScript methods like slice.
